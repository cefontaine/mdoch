Research project to implement molecular dynamics simulation by using [Chapel](http://chapel.cray.com/) parallel programming language.
  * To study the expressiveness of Chapel.
  * To study how to harness hybrid computing resources, e.g., CPU+GPU.
  * To study the performance and scalability of Chapel implementation.
  * To give hint for high-level designs, including application and programming languages.
